# SECURED-Framework-Verification

This repository contains resources related to the SECURED framework, focusing on the verification and security aspects of the architecture. The core component is an ontology-based model designed to ensure the integrity and consistency of the system, leveraging OWL for ontology representation and SWRL for rule-based threat detection.

Key elements of this repository include:

- The OWL file representing the SECURED ontology.
- Documentation on the modeling of system components, data flows, and threats.
- Rules for security verification and automated reasoning.
